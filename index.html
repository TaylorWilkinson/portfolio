        <p>
          Hello there! I am a normal human woman (definitely not a nursery of
          raccoons in a human suit) that codes for a living. My career in web
          development began in 2013 when I was playing with custom CSS on my
          secret One Direction tumblr blog. Once I realized “Wow, people do this
          for a living!” (“this” being coding and web design, not reposting
          2010s celeb photos), it propelled me to apply to SFU’s SIAT program -
          an interdisciplinary school that covered development, design, and
          media. I graduated in 2019 with my BSc. in Interactive Systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to now, I am working as a web developer in-house on a
          marketing team, working with internal stakeholders and marketers to
          maintain their website and manage web content. I still love playing
          with CSS to this day. Other tools and stacks I’ve used include
          Javascript, HTML5, React, Gatsby.js, Vue.js, and GraphQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I’m a zealous Dungeons & Dragons player and game
          master. I’m a hobby photographer, cat parent, tiktok enjoyer, and
