      <p class="bold">Oh gosh. Oh geez. You can't be here right now!</p>
      <p>
        Listen, I'm happy you're here, really. We need to hang out more - I say
        it all the time. It's just, I mean, you dropping in all unexpected like
        this. I didn't have any time to prepare! I need to refresh my
        presentation of work; I've gotta tidy up ahead of time; worst of all,
        there's not enough for me to put together a charcuterie board! I'm stuck
        here without so much as a jar of red pepper jelly looking like a fool! A
        fool I say!
      </p>

      <h2>what was wrong with my website before, you ask?</h2>
      <p>It's nothing too scandalous. Things ended amicably between us.</p>
      <p>
        In the end it's just that we outgrew eachother. We met in university, my
        needs have changed, and I realized our relationship simply reflected a
        younger version of who I was. Not exactly the air of professionalism,
        accomplishment, and talent I want to present these days. You know?

        You get it. Such a great reference. So funny and not at all dated.

        Well, the least I can do is entertain you in the meantime. Hmm. Umm. How
        about music! I love music. You like music, right? No - you can't have
        the aux cord.
